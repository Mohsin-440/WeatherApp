**Overview:**
The weather app is a web application built with Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Handlebars, and the Fetch API. It allows users to get real-time weather information for a specific location. The app leverages these technologies to provide a user-friendly interface and dynamic rendering of weather data.

**Backend: Node.js and Express**

Node.js and Express serve as the backend framework for routing and serving static files.
Express provides efficient handling of requests and responses between the app and the weather API.

**Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Handlebars**
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to create an intuitive and attractive user interface.
Handlebars is employed as the templating engine for dynamic rendering of weather data on the client-side.

**Weather Data Retrieval: Fetch API**
The app utilizes the Fetch API to make an HTTP request to a weather API.
The weather API provides real-time weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

**User Interaction: Search Functionality**
Users can search for a specific location to retrieve weather information.
Upon submitting the location, the app triggers the Fetch API request to obtain the relevant weather data.

**Dynamic Rendering: Handlebars Templating**
Handlebars dynamically renders the retrieved weather data by injecting it into predefined HTML templates.
This approach ensures a seamless and interactive user experience.

**Styling: CSS & Boostrap**
CSS styles the web application, creating an attractive and visually appealing user interface.

**Enhanced Functionality: JavaScript**
JavaScript enhances the app's functionality by enabling dynamic interactions and client-side data manipulation.

**Conclusion:**
The weather app, developed using Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Handlebars, and the Fetch API, provides users with a convenient way to access real-time weather information. With its intuitive interface, dynamic rendering of data, and user-friendly search functionality, the app enables users to plan their activities accordingly.
